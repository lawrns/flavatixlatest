## üéØ Mission Summary

Tested live production site at **https://flavatix.netlify.app** and investigated/fixed **10 reported issues**.

---

## ‚úÖ ISSUES FIXED (5 Issues)

### Issue #10: Review Save Error ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Problem:** Database constraint violation when saving reviews with unrated fields.

**Error Message:**
```
Error: new row for relation "quick_reviews" violates check constraint "quick_reviews_acidity_score_check"
HTTP 400 from Supabase
```

**Root Cause:** Database constraints require scores between 1-100, but form was sending 0 for unrated fields.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `pages/review/create.tsx` (lines 56-95)
- Added `|| null` to all score fields in database insert
- Converts 0 values to null before insertion
- Prevents constraint violations for all 10 score fields

**Result:** ‚úÖ Reviews can now be saved with unrated fields

---

### Issue #6: Study Mode 404 Error ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Problem:** 404 error after creating study mode tasting.

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Failed to lookup route: /taste/study/ffa3533e-9bba-4d45-b0ee-bef6fd2e3184
404: This page could not be found
```

**Root Cause:** 
- Study tasting created successfully in database
- Redirect to `/taste/study/[id]` failed because page didn't exist

**Fix Applied:**
- Created new page: `pages/taste/study/[id].tsx` (151 lines)
- Loads study session from database
- Uses existing `QuickTastingSession` component (already supports study mode)
- Includes proper error handling and loading states

**Result:** ‚úÖ Study mode tastings now load correctly after creation

---

### Issue #9: Quick Tasting Fields Not Disabled
**Problem:** Session name and category remained editable after adding items, causing potential confusion.

**Fix Applied:**

1. **QuickTastingSession.tsx** (lines 567-594):
   - Added conditional logic: `items.length > 1` disables editing
   - Changed cursor to `cursor-not-allowed` with opacity
   - Removed Edit icon when disabled
   - Added tooltip: "Cannot edit session name after adding items"

2. **CategoryDropdown.tsx**:
   - Added `disabled` prop to interface and component
   - Updated select element to respect disabled state
   - Added tooltip: "Cannot change category after adding items"

3. **QuickTastingSession.tsx** (line 620):
   - Passed `disabled={items.length > 1}` to CategoryDropdown

**Result:** ‚úÖ Session name and category locked after adding 2nd item

---

### Issue #7: My Tastings Content Hidden by Bottom Nav
**Problem:** Last tasting cards partially hidden by bottom navigation bar.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `pages/my-tastings.tsx` (line 89)
- Changed `pb-20` to `pb-32` (5rem ‚Üí 8rem)
- Provides adequate clearance for bottom navigation

**Result:** ‚úÖ All tasting cards fully visible with proper spacing

---

### Issue #5: Auto-Include in Ranking
**Problem:** "Include in ranking summary" checkbox not automatically checked when scale input enabled.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `pages/taste/create/study/new.tsx` (lines 385-397)
- Added auto-check logic to Scale Input onChange handler
- When scale input is checked, ranking checkbox auto-checks
- When scale input is unchecked, ranking checkbox state preserved

**Result:** ‚úÖ Ranking auto-enables with scale input for better UX

---

## üìã ISSUE #3: UX Improvement (Not a Bug)

### Issue #3: "Add Category" Button Positioning
**Status:** ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED - LOW PRIORITY UX IMPROVEMENT**

**Current Behavior:** 
- "Add Category" button positioned at top-right of Categories section header
- Located at `/taste/create/study/new` page

**Suggested Improvement:** 
- Move button to bottom of form for better UX flow
- Users would fill in categories, then add more at bottom

**Priority:** Low (cosmetic improvement, not affecting functionality)
