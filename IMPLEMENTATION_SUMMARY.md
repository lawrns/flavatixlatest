4. **Slider not sliding** ✅
   - Fixed `slider-ultra-thin` CSS class in `styles/globals.css`
   - Changed thumb from invisible (height: 0, opacity: 0, pointer-events: none) to interactive
   - Added proper cursor states (grab/grabbing) for better UX
   - Slider now properly draggable on all devices

5. **Score display showing X/5 instead of X/100** ✅
   - Fixed in `components/quick-tasting/QuickTastingSummary.tsx`
