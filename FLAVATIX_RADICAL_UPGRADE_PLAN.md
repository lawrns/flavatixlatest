## RISK MITIGATION

### Major Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|

| User Backlash to Paywall | Grandfathered free access, generous free tier, user feedback |
| High Churn | Focus on retention, regular feature releases, engagement loops |
| High AI Costs | Implement caching, aggressive free tier limits, batch processing |
| E-Commerce Complexity | Start with affiliate partnerships, not direct sales |

### Mitigation Strategy

**Grandfathered Free Users**: 
- Existing users keep free access to Pro features (limited time)

- Just lacks premium conveniences (unlimited AI, analytics, exports)
- 80% of casual users satisfied with free

**Regular Feature Releases**:
- New features quarterly
- Some exclusive to Pro (justifies upgrade)
- Some free (shows development momentum)

**Community Feedback Loop**:
- Monthly surveys of free users
- Feature voting system
- Transparent roadmap
