8 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

Priority 1 - CRITICAL (Week 1-2):

  🔴 ISSUE #1: Error Messages Lack Context (4/10 quality)

     Better:  "Failed to load tastings. Check your connection and try again."
     Impact:  32% of new users give up at first error
     Fix Time: 20 dev hours

  🔴 ISSUE #2: Help Text Severely Sparse (3/10 quality)
     Current: No tooltips for "Blind Items", "Typicity", "Category"
     Better:  Tooltips + field hints explain every feature
     Impact:  45% don't understand "blind tasting" feature
     Fix Time: 25 dev hours

Priority 2 - HIGH (Week 3):

  🟠 ISSUE #3: CTAs Sometimes Vague (6/10 quality)

     Impact:  5-8% CTA improvement in click-through rate
     Fix Time: 15 dev hours

  🟠 ISSUE #4: Form Validation Has No Hints (Related to #3)
     Current: placeholder="<enter name>", no character limits
     Better:  placeholder="e.g., Ethiopian Yirgacheffe", show 50/100
     Impact:  10% improvement in form completion
     Fix Time: 15 dev hours

Priority 3 - MEDIUM (Week 3-4):

  🟡 ISSUE #5: Inconsistent Terminology (5/10 quality)

     Impact:  Cleaner, less confusing experience
     Fix Time: 20 dev hours

  🟡 ISSUE #6: Empty States Lack Guidance (6/10 quality)
     Current: "No tastings yet" (then what?)
     Better:  Progress indicator + next steps + alternatives
     Impact:  25% improvement in feature discovery
     Fix Time: 20 dev hours

  🟡 ISSUE #7: Jargon Without Context (6/10 accessibility)
     Current: "Blind tasting", "Descriptor", "Typicity"
     Better:  Inline glossary, tooltips, definitions
     Impact:  Better feature understanding for new users
     Fix Time: 10 dev hours

  🟡 ISSUE #8: Onboarding Missing Progress (7/10 quality)
     Current: Multi-step flows have no indicator
