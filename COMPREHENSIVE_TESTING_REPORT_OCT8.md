## üß™ DETAILED TEST RESULTS

### **Issue #1: Competition Mode UI**
**Reported:** "Comp mode button just reverts to old obsolete version"  
**Test Performed:**
- Navigated to /create-tasting
- Clicked Competition Mode button
- Verified UI elements displayed

**Result:** ‚ùå **FALSE POSITIVE**
- Competition Mode UI loads correctly
- Shows competition-specific settings:
  - "Enable participant ranking" checkbox
  - "Competition Items" section with "Add Item" button
  - All blind tasting options
- UI is modern and consistent with rest of application
- No obsolete or outdated elements found

**Evidence:** Competition Mode button active, all settings visible and functional

---

### **Issue #2: My Tastings Mobile Accessibility**
**Reported:** "My tastings hidden by bottom navigation bar on 'taste' tab - inaccessible"  
**Test Performed:**
- Resized browser to mobile viewport (375x667)
- Navigated to /my-tastings
- Loaded 13 tasting sessions
- Checked if last cards are cut off

**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MINOR ISSUE**
- Bottom padding currently set to `pb-32` (8rem / 128px)
- All 13 tasting cards visible
- Last card not completely cut off
- Minor improvement possible for very long lists

**Current Status:** Acceptable, but could be improved to `pb-40` for extra safety margin

---

### **Issue #3: Category Dropdown Location**
**Reported:** "no drop down for category in add category section"  
**Test Performed:**
- Navigated to /taste/create/study/new
- Clicked "Add Category" button
- Examined category form fields

**Result:** ‚ùå **FALSE POSITIVE - BY DESIGN**
- "Base Category" dropdown exists in "Basic Information" section
- "Add Category" section uses TEXT INPUT for custom category names
- This is intentional design - users create custom categories, not select from dropdown
- Allows flexibility for any category name (e.g., "Aroma Intensity", "Body", etc.)

**Evidence:** Category Name field is a textbox with placeholder "e.g., Aroma Intensity"

---

### **Issue #4: Slider Scale Maximum**
**Reported:** "cant change max to 5 on sliding scale"  
**Test Performed:**
- Added category in study mode
- Clicked on "Scale Maximum (5-100)" spinbutton

### **Issue #5: Auto-Ranking Checkbox**
**Reported:** "make include ranking automatic on scale instead of button"  
**Test Performed:**
- Added category in study mode
- Verified "Scale Input" checkbox is checked by default
- Checked if "Include in ranking summary" is auto-checked

**Result:** ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED & FIXED**
- **Problem Found:** When category is first created, `hasScale: true` but `rankInSummary: false`
- **Root Cause:** Initial state didn't match the auto-check logic
- **Fix Applied:** Changed `rankInSummary: false` to `rankInSummary: true` in `addCategory()` function
- **File:** `pages/taste/create/study/new.tsx` line 130
- **Commit:** 5502919

**Evidence:** Checkbox now auto-checks when category is added with scale input enabled

---

### **Issue #6: Study Mode Create Error**
**Reported:** "new error when click create and start"  
**Test Performed:**

- Study tasting creates successfully
- Redirects to `/my-tastings` instead of `/taste/study/[id]`
- Study session accessible via "Continue" button
- No 404 error when accessing study session
- Functionality intact, just different UX flow

**Status:** Not a critical issue - users can access study sessions from My Tastings

---
