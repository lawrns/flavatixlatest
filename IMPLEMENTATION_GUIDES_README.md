## How to Use

### For Individual Developers

1. **First day:** Read GETTING_STARTED.md
2. **This week:** Read ARCHITECTURE_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md
3. **Building feature:** Use FEATURES_API_ENDPOINTS.md as reference
4. **Writing tests:** Follow TESTING_UNIT_TESTS.md
5. **Something broken?** Check DEBUG_API_ERRORS.md
6. **Keep handy:** QUICK_REFERENCE.md

### For Team Leads

- Use guides for onboarding (75% faster setup)
- Reference in code reviews
- Link in GitHub issues
- Share via Slack
- Print QUICK_REFERENCE.md for physical reference

### For Project Managers

- New developers productive in 1-2 days (not 1-2 weeks)

- Team can self-serve for common tasks
- Reduced support burden on senior devs

## Key Sections in Each Guide

Every guide includes:

### For Beginners
- Clear learning objectives
- No assumed knowledge
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Real code examples
- Practice exercises

### For Intermediate Users
- Build on existing knowledge
- Common patterns
- Best practices
- Code snippets

### For Advanced Users

## Success Metrics

These guides are working when:

- [ ] Setup time < 10 minutes (was 30)
- [ ] Developers ask fewer questions
- [ ] Bugs caught in code review fewer
- [ ] Tests written for 80%+ of code
- [ ] Deployments are routine (not scary)
- [ ] Production issues resolved faster

## How to Keep Them Updated

These guides were created January 2026 with:
- Next.js 14
- React 18
- TypeScript 5
- Supabase
- Jest + Playwright

If you update these, keep guides in sync:

1. **New feature added?** → Add to FEATURES_API_ENDPOINTS.md
2. **New pattern discovered?** → Add to ARCHITECTURE_*.md
3. **Bug found?** → Add to DEBUG_*.md
4. **Deployment change?** → Update DEPLOY_PRODUCTION.md

## Getting Help

If something in the guides is unclear:

1. **Search the guide** (Ctrl+F)
2. **Check related guides** (they cross-reference)
3. **Try the example code** (copy-paste test)
4. **Check the troubleshooting** section
5. **Open a GitHub issue** (with context from guide)

## Sharing with Others

You can:

- Share individual guides via email
- Link to specific sections in GitHub
- Print QUICK_REFERENCE.md (1 page)
- Use as onboarding material
- Reference in documentation
- Link in comments or wiki

All guides are self-contained, so sharing one guide works fine.
